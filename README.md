# Laravel-Vue-Inertia Boilerplate
It's a simple boilerplate that I personally use for new Inertia projects. 
It's a fresh Laravel 6 installation with adjustments taken from [PingCRM](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm) (Inertia's demo application) to make things such as pagination more convenient.
Next to that there is not much special to this application.  
  
There is no styling built into the boilerplate at all (so no css framework).
I have some projects that need to happen with Bootstrap and others with Tailwind whereby I want this to be clean and without any.  
  
I might update this by times to add functionalities I pretty much all the time to make new project creation faster.  
Feel free to create a pull request as well for common functionalities that are missing.
